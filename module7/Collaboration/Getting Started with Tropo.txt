Creating a Tropo script with the Scripting API:
	1. Go to tropo.com
	2. Login
	3. My Apps -> Create Application
	4. Assign parameters to app:
		- Name
		- Scripting API
			* New Script (the file type is not automatically appended).  This will be your call script.
		- Web (HTTP) API
			* URL
		- Phone Number
	5. Click Create App
	6. In the app settings, rename the Text script and click Save Settings.
	7. Use the Edit Script links to edit the scripts.
	8. After saving settings in Tropo scripts, wait about 1 to 2 minutes before the changes will take effect in the live app.

	Keep your app in the development environment, not the production environment.
