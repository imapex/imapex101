# 12 Factor Concepts

## What is a "12 Factor" App and where did it come from

The 12 Factor Application is a methodology proposed in the early 2010s by core members of the Heroku team.  It is a well circulated and read proposal that focuses on "Cloud Native" application design concepts, however it is not perfect or univerally accepted.  Most will agree that it provides an ideal to strive towards, and a _violation_ of a factor should be done consciously and with reason.  

It is not the only _manifesto_ on Cloud Native development, but it is worth having exposure and understanding of.  

Full details at [12Factor.net](http://12factor.net) 

## The Factors 

### I. [Codebase](http://12factor.net/codebase)
One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

### II. [Dependencies](http://12factor.net/dependencies)
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

### III. [Config](http://12factor.net/config)
Store config in the environment

### IV. [Backing services](http://12factor.net/backing-services)
Treat backing services as attached resources

### V. [Build, release, run](http://12factor.net/build-release-run)
Strictly separate build and run stages

### VI. [Processes](http://12factor.net/processes)
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

### VII. [Port binding](http://12factor.net/port-binding)
Export services via port binding

### VIII. [Concurrency](http://12factor.net/concurrency)
Scale out via the process model

### IX. [Disposability](http://12factor.net/disposability)
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

### X. [Dev/prod parity](http://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity)
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

### XI. [Logs](http://12factor.net/logs)
Treat logs as event streams

### XII. [Admin processes](http://12factor.net/admin-processes)
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes

## A Stateless Aspiration

The 12 Factor Application describes a goal of a **stateless application**.  The refers to the goal that applications (and their components) should be able to come and go without any overall impact to the user or data.  This is core to the ablity to be fully "cloud native" and drive towards fully automated operations and portablity.  

This is a great target goal, and for many applications, or microservices within an application, it is useful and practical.  But as an overall strategy it has some significant problems that are important to be aware of.  

### Where's the data?

Nearly every application of significance has a need to gather, manipulate, store, and report on data.  At it's core, the 12 Factor principals do not accomidate for how to deal with data. 


## Why do we Care? 

Software development is like any other area of IT.  There are basic capabilities and technologies, then there are strategies for using them.  When we want to be relevant to network engineers, we study strategies and design with "3 Tier Network Architectures" and more recently "Spine-Leaf" in mind.  When we want to be relevant to software developers, we need to understand the common practices and methods to engage in discussions.  

## A sidebar on Secrets

In development a "secret" can loosely be defined as anything you wouldn't want everyone else in the world to know.  This includes the obvious things like: 

* Passwords 
* Authentication Tokens
* Usernames 
* Credit Card
* Account Information 

But it can also include things that aren't as directly damaging if they are lost such as: 

* Application and Server Names 
* API Endpoints and addresses 
* Email Addresses 
* IP Addresses and Port Numbers
* Domain Names 
* just about anythind descriptive about your environment... 

Factor III: Config talks about NOT including environment details in your code, but rather in the environment.  In many cases the "environment details" also qualify as **secrets** and you need to take care about how you are storing and transporting them throughout application development and deployment process.  It is very easy to commit secrets into a codebase (ie GitHub) and mistakeningly make your usernames and passwords publicly available on GitHub.

# Basic Linux Tools

> See, you not only have to be a good coder to create a system like Linux, you have to be a sneaky bastard too. -Linus Torvalds

> Linux has never been about quality. There are so many parts of the system that are just these cheap little hacks, and it happens to run. -Theo de Raadt

Some of the most difficult parts of developing are often less about coding, and more about operational tasks.  But sense the big theme in development these days is **Dev"Ops"** we can't get away from those tasks.  

Scripting has long been the swiss army knife for operations, and it continues to be valuable today.  There are several common Linux utilities that having a basic fundamental knowledge of will help you greatly as you work to develop and package your applications for others to use.  

## Example Prep

The following examples leverage the Weather.com API.  Developer access to the API is free and accounts can be created at [wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/).  You will need an API key to follow along with the examples.  

Once you have your API key, run this command at your command line to store your API key as a local environment variable.  

```
export WEATHER_API_KEY=<YOUR KEY>
```

The following examples will use the Cisco Spark API.  You'll need to have access to your Spark Developer Token to complete the exercises.  Find it at [developer.ciscospark.com](https://developer.ciscospark.com).  

Once you have your API key, run these commands at your command line to store your API key and some other details as a local environment variable.  

```
export SPARK_TOKEN=<YOUR TOKEN>
export MY_EMAIL=<YOUR EMAIL>
export PARTNER_EMAIL=<A LAB PARTNERS EMAIL>
```


## curl

curl is a general purpose command line utility for making requests to web servers.  It is often used for testing REST API calls, verifying a site is up and operational, or as part of bash scripts.  The number of potential arguments and options to curl can be mind-boggling, however knowing the following subset can be highly valuable as you get started.  

### Examples and Exercises 

* Basic curl request
  
  ```
  # List the Spark Teams you are a member of
  curl https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/teams
  
  # No data should be returned... 
  ```

* Inspect the HTTP Headers with `-v` to find out what happened... 
  
  ```
  curl -v https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/teams
  
	*   Trying 104.239.247.152...
	* Connected to api.ciscospark.com (104.239.247.152) port 443 (#0)
	* TLS 1.2 connection using TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
	* Server certificate: *.ciscospark.com
	* Server certificate: Go Daddy Secure Certificate Authority - G2
	* Server certificate: Go Daddy Root Certificate Authority - G2
	> GET /v1/teams HTTP/1.1
	> Host: api.ciscospark.com
	> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
	> Accept: */*
	>
	< HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
	< Content-Length: 0
	< Date: Tue, 26 Jul 2016 20:32:26 GMT
	< Server: Redacted
	< Trackingid: NA_69b0048b-3bab-4175-a2c0-f9272ba99c2d
	< X-Cf-Requestid: 9b78f835-9d29-46a9-5211-27c5cf34f59e
	< Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
	<
	* Connection #0 to host api.ciscospark.com left intact  
  ```  
  * Lines beginning with `>` indicate outgoing **REQUEST** headers while those with `<` are for incoming **RESPONSE** headers
  * The first **RESPONSE** header `HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized` indicates the problem.  We are _Unauthorized_. 
  * Most APIs require authentication/authorization
* Cisco Spark, and many other services, use Request Headers to provide authenticaiton information.  
	* Set a Request Header with `-H "<Header-Name>: <Value>` argument.  Multiple `-H` arguments are supported.
	* OAUTH2 is a common mechanism used for authentication, and is used by Cisco Spark.  It leverages a Request Header called **Authorization** with a value of _Bearer \<TOKEN\>_

	```
	curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPARK_TOKEN" \
		https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/teams	
	
	{"items":[{"id":"...","name":"MidW/A imapex","created":"2016-06-29T13:29:05.416Z"}]}
	```
* curl will simply write out the data as returned by the server, and it isn't always in a handy format, particularly when returned as raw JSON.  You can "pipe" JSON data to an included python module to make it more readable.  

	```
	curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPARK_TOKEN" \
		https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/teams \
		| python -m json.tool
		
	  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
	                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
	100   904  100   904    0     0    428      0  0:00:02  0:00:02 --:--:--   428
	{
	    "items": [
	        {
	            "created": "2016-06-29T13:29:05.416Z",
	            "id": "...",
	            "name": "MidW/A imapex"
	        }
	    ]
	}
	```  
* Some other sites leverage Basic Authenticaiton with usernames and passwords.  These can be used with curl using the `-u <username>:<password>` format.  
	
	```
	# Example using basic authentication with a ficticious site
	curl -u admin:password http://api.basicauth.com
	```
* You can capture the returned data (not headers, just data) using the `-o <file>` option to curl.  
	* _You can use `-o /dev/null` as a shortcut to drop any returned data if only interested in headers or testing_

	```
	curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPARK_TOKEN" \
		https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/teams -o teams.json
	
	ls -l 	
	-rw-r--r--  1 user123  staff  904 Jul 26 15:49 teams.json
	
	```	
	
* If you want to capture the Headers to a file, use the `-D <file>` argument. 

	```
	curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPARK_TOKEN" \
		https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/teams \
		-D headers.txt
	
	ls -l
	total 16
	-rw-r--r--  1 user123  staff  296 Jul 26 16:10 headers.txt
	```

* By default curl sends an HTTP **GET** method.  To send other methods, use the `-X` option.  

	```
	curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPARK_TOKEN" \
		https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/messages 
	
	{"message":"Required request body is missing","errors":[{"description":"Required request body is missing"}],"trackingId":"NA_c4d9d517-3617-4b6a-a521-dc2a26334dd6"}
	
	# When POSTING, you often have to include data, as the error message indicates
	```

* With curl you can send data to a server as part of an API request as well.  The `-d` flag is used, and several options exist for providing the data.  You'll often need to include a `-H "Content-type: application/json"` header as well indicating the type of data being sent.  
	* Inline 

	```	
	# When sending JSON data, you need to escape inner quotes
	curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $SPARK_TOKEN" \
		-H "Content-type: application/json" \
		https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/messages \
		-d "{\"toPersonEmail\": \"$PARTNER_EMAIL\",\"text\": \"Test message from lab\"}"
	
	{"id":"...","roomId":"...","toPersonEmail":"...","roomType":"direct","text":"Test message from lab","personId":"...","personEmail":"...","created":"2016-07-26T21:05:00.330Z"}
	
	
	```

* If you are making a request to an HTTPs site, but one that lacks a fully verifiable certificate, curl will by default throw an error.  You can use the `-k` option to allow insecure connections.  

	```
	# Example command 
	curl -k https://badsecurity.com
	```  
	
* If you need to leverage a proxy server to access the site, use `-x <proxy>`

	```
	# Example command 
	curl -x "https://myproxyserver.com:8080" http://internet.com 
	```

	* Send a message to the room
	* Retrieve the messages from the room
		
### Helpful Hints and Gotchas

* Escaping command characters


## awk

awk is a very powerful pattern matching and processing program for lines of text.  Becoming a power user of awk will take years, but even a little bit of capability can be very helpful for processing text files (or more commonly, data returned from other programs).  

Here is a very basic awk command to disect

```
awk '/hello/ { print $2 }' hello.txt
```

* `awk` - the program to run 
* `'/hello/ { print $2 }'` - the action awk is being instructed to do
	* `/hello/` - the first part indicates the **match** part of the command using regular expressions.  In this case, match any line containing 'hello'
	* `{ print $2 }` - the second part is what to do with the match lines.  Here we are asking to print out the second field.  By default, awk considers whitespace to be field delimeters. 
* `hello.txt` - the file to process

### Experiments

* Create a file called `hello.txt` that contains this data 
	
	```
	hello world
	goodbye world
	good morning
	good evening
	life is a box of chocolates
	you never know what you're going to get
	```

* Print the first word in each sentance 

	```
	awk '{ print $1 }' hello.txt
	
	hello
	goodbye
	good
	good
	life
	you
	```	

* Print the second word in all lines containing the word 'good'

	```
	awk '/good/ { print $2 }' hello.txt
	
	world
	morning
	evening
	
	# what if we don't want "goodbye" to match 
	awk '/good / { print $2 }' hello.txt
	
	morning
	evening
	```

* Count the number of lines containing 'world'

	```
	awk '/world/{++cnt} END {print "Count = ", cnt}' hello.txt
	```

* [http://www.catonmat.net/download/awk.cheat.sheet.pdf](http://www.catonmat.net/download/awk.cheat.sheet.pdf)

### Go Do it Exercises 

* Download the text of Hamlet for the following exercies 

	```
	wget https://archive.org/download/hamlet01524gut/2ws2610.txt
	```

* Print out all lines containing the word 'Hamlet'
* Count the lines containing 'Death'
* Print all lines containing both 'Death' and 'Hamlet'


## grep

grep, and it's many variations, is a commonly used pattern matching utility.  It leverages regular expressions to output lines matching a given pattern.  Unlike awk, grep simply returns the matched lines as they are, no processing on output is done.  

grep is often used as a secondary command where output from one command is "piped" to it for filtering.  This example shows a common usage. 

```
ls ~/coding | grep imapex

imapex
imapex101
```

The power of grep comes by leveraging actual regular expressions, and not just static patterns.  

### Experiments 

These examples will use the hello.txt file created above.  

```
cat hello.txt

hello world
goodbye world
good morning
good evening
life is a box of chocolates
you never know what you're going to get
```

* Match lines containing the word 'hello'

	```
	grep 'hello' hello.txt
	
	hello world
	```
	
* Match lines containing the word 'hello' or 'world'

	```
	grep '(hello)|(world)' hello.txt
	
	# Nothing returned... 
	# Because this qualifies as an "extended" regular expression
	# use grep -E or egrep 
	
	grep -E '(hello)|(world)' hello.txt
	
	hello world
	goodbye world
	```

* Match lines containing the letter 'x' or the leter 't'

	```
	egrep '[xt]' hello.txt
	
	```

### Go do it exercises 

Using the text copy of Hamlet from above 

* Find all lines where Hamlet is the FIRST word 
* Find all lines where death is the LAST word 
	* Find lines where there is a single character following the word death at the end of a line  
* Are there any lines where 'Hamlet' and 'madness' appear on the same line?  

## sed

sed is the **s**tream **ed**itor tool in Unix.  Stream means is makes changes while it process data flowing through the application.  It is most often used for making changes to files (either in place or to create a new file).  

### Experiments 

* Change 'sad' to 'happy' 
	* Use the `s/regex/repl/` command structure.  `s` means substitute. 

	```
	echo 'I am sad.' | sed 's/sad/happy/'
	
	I am happy.
	```
	
* Again, but really sad
	* Need to use the `g` flag to indicate a global change, and not just a first match change. 

	```
	echo 'I am sad.  So very very sad...' | sed 's/sad/happy/g'
	
	I am happy.  So very very happy...
	```

* If you are matching text that contains `/` it can be a pain to escape them all, so you can use `_`, `:`, `|` as alternatives.  Just pick something that isn't in your string.  

	```
	echo 'I am sad.  So very very sad...' | sed 's:sad:happy:g'
	
	I am happy.  So very very happy...
	```

* sed much more useful working with files.  Let's emphasize 'good' to 'GOOD'

	```
	sed 's/good/GOOD/' hello.txt
	
	hello world
	GOODbye world
	GOOD morning
	GOOD evening
	life is a box of chocolates
	you never know what you're going to get
	
	# Whoops... didn't want to chagne goodbye, indicate word breaks
	sed 's/good /GOOD /' hello.txt
	
	hello world
	goodbye world
	GOOD morning
	GOOD evening
	life is a box of chocolates
	you never know what you're going to get
	```

* And save the output to a new file 

	```
	sed 's/good /GOOD /' hello.txt > hello2.txt
	```

* Update the original file (and backup the old data) 

	```
	sed -i '.bak' 's/good /GOOD /' hello.txt 
	
	cat hello.txt
	
	hello world
	goodbye world
	GOOD morning
	GOOD evening
	life is a box of chocolates
	you never know what you're going to get
	
	# Put it back the way it was... 
	sed -i '.bak' 's/GOOD /good /' hello.txt 
	```

### Go do it exercises

Once again using Hamlet

* Create a new copy of the Hamlet text called 'Omlet' where all references to Hamlet are changed to Omlet 
* Create a new copy of Hamlet where references to death are changed to life


## bash scripts

Using the above tools individually can be very helpful, but where you're most likely to use them will be as part of a bash script to setup or deploy your applicaiton.  Or as the entire application itself.  

The simplest bash scripts just execute a command, or series of commands, but the most useful ones leverage processing logic similar to other scripting or programming languages.  Here we'll go through the most common constructs to be familiar using.  

### The sh-bang line
Begin your scripts like this so the computer knows how to execute them.  

```
#! /bin/bash
```

### Using variables 

```
# Create a variable called myvar 
myvar="Hello world!"

# Use the variable 
echo $myvar

```

### Asking user for input 
You can ask the user to provide an input.  It then becomes available as a variable.  

```
# Ask user for their name
echo "What is your name?"

# "read" the input and save to variable 
read username

echo "The name given was: $username."

```

### If statements 

```
if [ $username == "Hank" ]
then 
	echo "You are Hank."
else
	echo "Nope... you are not Hank."
fi
```

#### Basic Conditionals to know

* String comparisons 
	* `==` - strings are equal 
	* `!=` - strings are NOT equal 
* Numeric Comparisons 
	* `-eq` - equal 
	* `-ne` - NOT equal 
	* `-gt` - greater than 
	* `-ge` - greater than or equal
	* `-lt` - less than 
	* `-le` - less than or equal
	
#### Testing success/failure of a command

A very common usage of the if condition is to test if a previous command exited successfully, indicated by an exit code of `0`.  ANything other than a `0` is considered to be an error condition.  The variable `$?` will contain the exit code from the last run command.  Here is a simple script that verifies a successful execution of the previous command.  

```
#! /bin/bash 

echo "This will work!"

if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then 
	echo "Yep it worked"
else 
	echo "It didn't work :( " 
fi

```

### Loops 
Looping in bash is a little different from other languages... 

* for loops - Used to iterate over a list of words in a string

	```
	#!/bin/bash
   for i in $( ls ); do
       echo item: $i
   done		
	```
	
* while loops - Loops until a condition is met 

	```
	#!/bin/bash 
	COUNTER=0
	while [  $COUNTER -lt 10 ]; do
		echo The counter is $COUNTER
		COUNTER=COUNTER+1 
	done	
	```	

#### Common use of While loop... waiting for something to happen

In a script, you may want to wait for some previous command to have its full effect, or some other condition to come about.  You can use the while loop for this to test your condition, but it's a good idea to insert a `sleep` command in the loop to prevent your script from testing a condition to rapidly.  You can quickly have a negative effect on your own or remote machines by loops that are uncontrolled.  Here's an example with a sleep inserted to pause 5 seconds between entries.  

```
#!/bin/bash 
COUNTER=0
while [  $COUNTER -lt 10 ]; do
	echo The counter is $COUNTER
	COUNTER=COUNTER+1 
	sleep 5
done	
```

### Example script walkthrough 

Let's look at an example real script used as part of the [MyHero Demo](https://github.com/hpreston/myhero_demo) application.  

[Sample myhero_install.sh](https://github.com/hpreston/myhero_demo/blob/master/myhero-install.sh)

### Go do it exercises 

This exercise will combine skills from the full Linux tools content.  

* Create a bash script that does the following
	* Ask the user for their Spark Token 
	* Use that token to make an API call to Spark and get a list of their Spark Rooms.  Save the outputed JSON into a file.  Be sure to format the JSON in a pretty way.  
	* Search through the Saved file and create a new file containing the list of roomIds, and only the roomIds
	* Create a new file based on the full returned room JSON where all double quotes are replaced with single quotes.  

# Vagrant 

Vagrant is a tool for developers to make preparing, managing, and replicating a dedicated development environment as easy and painless as possible.  It is **NOT** intended to manage or deploy production environments.  It **IS** intended to make a development environment as close to a production environment as practical and possible.  

### Before Vagrant

Before Vagrant... developers used one of the following methods when developing softare

* Locally on their physical machine 
* Request Virtual Machines for development from IT or other source 
* Run their own VM platform
	* On a personal dedicated server.  The ESX server in the corner or under the desk.  
	* With something like Virtual Box or VM Fusion on their workstation.  
* Or whatever else they could come up with.  

All of these options presented many problems

* Time delays in getting new development environments
* Managing their own dev platforms 
* Significant Differences between Dev and Production
* Shared development environments for multiple projects 
* Rebuilding a new environment takes time

### Supported Development Environment

Vagrant is often used along with Virtualbox to provide a local dev environment on the developers own computer, but it can also leverage other providers.  

Out of the box support for 

* Virtualbox 
* Docker
* Hyper-V

Plugins available for 

* VMware
* AWS
* Others... 

### Sidebar on Docker

Vagrant is often thought of, and started out, as a VM based tool.  With the push in development towards containers, and Docker specifically, it is now often used for container based development as well.  There are two ways to work with Docker containers and Vagrant

#### Option 1: Direct Docker Support

If your underlying computer can support running containers natively, Vagrant can directly deploy containers to the Docker daemon on your workstation (or a remote host).  

#### Option 2: Docker inside a VM

For a long time, you could only run Docker natively on a Linux OS.  To run Docker on Mac or Windows you needed to run a Linux based VM, and then run Docker inside the VM.  Technologies like Docker Toolbox, Docker Machine, and boot2docker all worked to make this easier.  Vagrant can use this model to also support Docker development by first creating a host VM, installing Docker into the VM, and then deploying containers on the VM.  

### Key Concepts and Terms with Vagrant 

* `vagrant up`
	* The simple command needed to bring up the full development environment
* `Vagrantfile`
	* The configuration file used by Vagrant to describe the development environment needed
	* When you `vagrant up`, vagrant will look for a file called `Vagrantfile` in the working directory.  You can use a differnet name, but you'll need to specify it
* A **box**
	* Vagrant refers to the source images or templates it uses to provision new development environments as **boxes**
	* You can build your own boxes, but there is a very large assortment of available ones maintained by the community 
	* Each **box** is for a particular provider, but most underlying OS's or platforms have boxes available for all common providers.  

## Experiments 

We'll create a new directory and walk through some basic Vagrant exercises.  

* Create the new directory, and initialize vagrant for the project 

	```
	mkdir imapex101vagrant
	cd imapex101vagrant
	vagrant init	centos/7
	
	A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
	ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
	the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
	`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
	```

* `vagrant init centos/7` creates a basic Vagrantfile in the directory.  the `centos/7` part identifies the **box** that we'll use.  Let's take a look. 

	```
	cat Vagrantfile 
	
	# -*- mode: ruby -*-
	# vi: set ft=ruby :
	
	# All Vagrant configuration is done below. The "2" in Vagrant.configure
	# configures the configuration version (we support older styles for
	# backwards compatibility). Please don't change it unless you know what
	# you're doing.
	Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
	  # The most common configuration options are documented and commented below.
	  # For a complete reference, please see the online documentation at
	  # https://docs.vagrantup.com.
	
	  # Every Vagrant development environment requires a box. You can search for
	  # boxes at https://atlas.hashicorp.com/search.
	  config.vm.box = "centos/7"
	
	  # Disable automatic box update checking. If you disable this, then
	  # boxes will only be checked for updates when the user runs
	  # `vagrant box outdated`. This is not recommended.
	  # config.vm.box_check_update = false
	
	  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
	  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
	  # accessing "localhost:8080" will access port 80 on the guest machine.
	  # config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 80, host: 8080
	
	  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
	  # using a specific IP.
	  # config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.10"
	
	  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
	  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
	  # your network.
	  # config.vm.network "public_network"
	
	  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
	  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
	  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
	  # argument is a set of non-required options.
	  # config.vm.synced_folder "../data", "/vagrant_data"
	
	  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
	  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
	  # Example for VirtualBox:
	  #
	  # config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
	  #   # Display the VirtualBox GUI when booting the machine
	  #   vb.gui = true
	  #
	  #   # Customize the amount of memory on the VM:
	  #   vb.memory = "1024"
	  # end
	  #
	  # View the documentation for the provider you are using for more
	  # information on available options.
	
	  # Define a Vagrant Push strategy for pushing to Atlas. Other push strategies
	  # such as FTP and Heroku are also available. See the documentation at
	  # https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/push/atlas.html for more information.
	  # config.push.define "atlas" do |push|
	  #   push.app = "YOUR_ATLAS_USERNAME/YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME"
	  # end
	
	  # Enable provisioning with a shell script. Additional provisioners such as
	  # Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, and Docker are also available. Please see the
	  # documentation for more information about their specific syntax and use.
	  # config.vm.provision "shell", inline: <<-SHELL
	  #   sudo apt-get update
	  #   sudo apt-get install -y apache2
	  # SHELL
	end
	```
	
	* The basic Vagrantfile is nearly all just comments and sample configurations for customization.  Only a very small part is actually active.  That part is listed here to highlight how little is needed to get started with vagrant
	
	```
	Vagrant.configure(2) do |config|
	  config.vm.box = "centos/7"
	end		
	```
	
* Initialize the development environment

	```
	vagrant up

	* 	The output describes the process that is taken to start the environment.  The configuraiton and process is all determined by the `Vagrantfile`.  In our case, there was very little specified, so all configuraiton here is based on the defaults.  The defaults are built to provide a useable environment very easily, with little work by the developer.  
*  Explore the vagrant tools some

	```
	# Get current status of vagrant for this project
	vagrant status
	
	Current machine states:

	The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
	shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
	suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
	simply run `vagrant up`.	
	```	
	```	
	# Sometimes you may want to check the status of vagrant 
	# environments on your entire computer, not just the current directory
	vagrant global-status

	The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
	on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
	up-to-date. To interact with any of the machines, you can go to
	that directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly
	with Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
	"vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
	
	```
	
	* In this example you can see that I have several differnet environments running.  Some based on virtualbox, others on docker.  If you want to target an environment that is NOT your current directory, you can specify the id value in the command.  Such as `vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d`

	```
	# Log into your newly created environment 
	vagrant ssh 
	
	# this places you into the virtual environment
	# follow along with the commands entered at the prompts
	[vagrant@localhost ~]$ pwd
	/home/vagrant
	
	# Vagrant boxes typically use a user called "vagrant"
	# In that users's home directory is a folder called "sync" 
	[vagrant@localhost ~]$ ls -l

	[vagrant@localhost ~]$ ls -l sync/
	total 4
	-rw-r--r--. 1 vagrant vagrant 3020 Jul 27 14:20 Vagrantfile

	# The "sync" folder is linked to the project directory on 
	# your computer.  This makes development easy because you 
	# can develop on your laptop using your local tools, and 
	# immediately test and run code inside the enviornment without
	# manual coping and transferring code
	
	# type exit to return to your local terminal
	exit
	```

* Let's lifecycle the environment
	
	```
	# Run this command to get a glimpse at the different lifecycle actions 
	
	vagrant ? | grep "up\|destroy\|halt\|reload\|resume\|suspend"
	
	     destroy         stops and deletes all traces of the vagrant machine
	     halt            stops the vagrant machine
	     plugin          manages plugins: install, uninstall, update, etc.
	     reload          restarts vagrant machine, loads new Vagrantfile configuration
	     resume          resume a suspended vagrant machine
	     suspend         suspends the machine
	     up              starts and provisions the vagrant environment
	
	# use suspend and resume together 
	# reload rebuilds the environment from scratch, helpful if you change the Vagrantfile 
	# halt is like shuttingdown a guest OS, but it is NOT deleted
	# destroy shutsdown and deletes 
	# up only works for a "halted" or non-existent environment 
	
	# experiment with the options, and then 
	vagrant destroy
	
	    default: Are you sure you want to destroy the 'default' VM? [y/N] y
	==> default: Forcing shutdown of VM...
	==> default: Destroying VM and associated drives...

## Why do we care 

Development in general, but Cloud Native development for sure, are all about using techinques and tools to make their world easier.  Concepts like _Infrastructure as Code_ started with them, and tools like this.  Understanding how a modern developer works, learning to use their tools, will make having a dialog with them much easier.  

It will also help you as you talk with Infrastructure teams to be able to educate them on these types of concepts.  

## Go do it Exercises 

One of the nicest things about Vagrant, is the ability to embed the development environment into the code repositories.  You will find many code repo's that include a Vagrantfile to make development easier.  

* Take a look at the [hpreston/myhero_data](https://github.com/hpreston/myhero_data) repo and read through the README section on development environments.  
* Clone the repo locally and "vagrant up" the environment and try to interact with the microservice API.  
* Review the Vagrantfile and Vagrantfile.host and see if you can follow how they work together to provide a Docker environment with Vagrant

# OpenSource Licenses 

## What is OpenSource 

"Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance." [OpenSource.com](https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source) 

#### Is OpenSource "Free"?

No... sorta... not really... 

OpenSource licenses often require the software be free to distribute, but there is typically no limitation on charging for Support, Installation, Troubleshooting, etc.  ie RedHat's Model 

Also, developing OpenSource software is no simpler than developing proprietary software.  Some projects are done as side projects, but many are done by paid programmers.  

#### Why do people like OpenSource? 

Lots of reasons... many cite

* Control
* Training
* Security
* Stability 

#### Is OpenSource inherintly better, more stable, more secure?  

Nope... remember [Heartbleed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed)

### Considerations for Choosing One

Any software product has a "license" that is attached.  We see and agree to these licenses all the time, but we've become so accustomed to "Click to accept" that we don't even realize it.  

With OpenSource Projects, you could write your own license that said whatever you wanted, but that's kinda boring.  So there are several available options that are often used.  

Licenses will typically address the following characteristics. And their treatment of each often determines what license makes sense for a project.  

#### Permissions
What are you allowed to do... 

* **Use - Commercial vs Private**
	* Can you use the software to make money
* **Distribution**
	* Are you allowed to freely distribute the software
* **Modification**
	* Are you allowed to change the software
* **Patent Use**
	* Can you use the software as part of a patent

#### Conditions
What must you do... 

* **OpenSource** 
	* Actually provide the source code 
* **License and Copyright Notificaitons** 
	* Clearly indicate that you are using the licensed products 
* **Copyleft**
	* Whether other products, products must use the same license 
* **State Changes**
	* Explicitly state all changes  

#### Limiations
Protections and other footnotes

* **Liability**
	* Whether the creator can be held liable for damages
* **Trademark Use**
	* Usage related to trademarking.

## Why Do We Care? 

OpenSource has always been popular, but its popularity is raising at a very fast level.  We are seeing large enterprises, across verticles, embracing OpenSource Software like never before.  And this is in some very critical areas where traditionally they would have selected a more traditional commercial vendor.  Even commercial software vendors, traditionally very anti-OpenSource, are starting to embrace OpenSource in a big way.  This could be as a user, contributor, or initiator of projects.  

Not all OpenSource projects and licenses are the same though, and as you jump into this world as an individual, you need to be able to differentiate between the different licenses that you'll run into so you can make apprporiate decisions about which projects to use and contribute to.  Also, deciding on an appropriate license for your own projects is an important decision that can have significant consequenses.  

## Go Do It Exercises 

Look at some popular OpenSource projects and find the license that they are published under.  Here are some ideas, but feel free to look elsewhere.  

* Ubuntu
* Apache
* HA-Proxy
* Cisco Mantl
* Terraform
* Vagrant
* Cisco Contiv

## pip

Python uses pip to install and manage packages and optional modules.  Likely you've used it already, but here we're going to talk about how to use it and capture details for packaging into your application.  

The common practice with python applciations is to include a file called `requirements.txt` that lists out all the packages needed for an application.  

### Experiments

*In these experiements, you're output will likley differ greatly as you're querying your local Python installation.* 

* Let's take a look at the currently installed packages

	```
	pip freeze
	
	You are using pip version 7.1.0, however version 8.1.2 is available.
	You should consider upgrading via the 'pip install --upgrade pip' command.
	argumentparser==1.2.1
	Flask==0.10.1
	itsdangerous==0.24
	Jinja2==2.8
	MarkupSafe==0.23
	Werkzeug==0.11.5
	wheel==0.24.0
	
	```
	
	* `pip freeze` queries the active python interpreter for all installed modules and their versions.  It then outputs it in the displayed format that can be fed into a `pip install` command to ensure proper dependencies are met.
* Use `pip freeze` to create a requirements.txt file for a project 

	```
	pip freeze > requirements.txt 
	
	cat requirements.txt 
	
	argumentparser==1.2.1
	Flask==0.10.1
	itsdangerous==0.24
	Jinja2==2.8
	MarkupSafe==0.23
	Werkzeug==0.11.5
	wheel==0.24.0
	
	```

* You would include the `requirements.txt` file in your code repo to document dependencies.  
* Then in setup instructions, Dockerfiles, Vagrantfiles, or other areas where you are installing your software, you'd use the file like this to install the proper dependencies into the working environment for your application.  

	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt 
	
	```

	* In this case, we just read the current state to create the file, so you'll likely get notes back that `Requirement already satisfied`

### Why do we care

It is up to the developer today to consider dependencies when building applciations, and if you follow the 12 Factor App principals, declaration and islotation are critical.  As we're setting out to build application demos, understanding how to address dependencies is critical to providing useful applicaitons, and not just toy-code.  

Every language and framework for development has dependencies.  One part of learning a language you plan to use for application or demo development needs to be a consideration on how they are handled and documented.  You'll want to find the equivelant of *pip* in whichever langague you are using.  

## virtualenv

Virtual Environments are a capability of Python to create isolated working environments on a single machine with completely different configuraitons and dependencies deployed.  Nearly everyone in IT has horror stories of dependency conflicts between software installed on the same computer.  

One example that came up quite a bit in the past was software that leveraged a component of Microsoft Office (ie Word or Excel) as part of its functionality.  Most of these cases required a very specific, and often outdated, version of Office to function.  This would mean that users were unable to update Office on their computers, because it would break some other software.  To solve the, several enterprises leveraged Citrix to isolate applacation environments from one another.  

The second factor in the 12 Factors talks about isolating dependencies.  Virtual Environments, or virtualenv, within Python provide a very easy and elegant way to accomplish this for Python applications.  You can have two different Python programs, running on the same host, leveraging completley different versions of a module.  

A secondary benefit, but very important as well, is the ability to limit the modules added to a virtualenv to just those needed by the software.  If you were to use a single environment for every possible Python applciation you might run, you'll end up with hundreds of different packages installed.  And like anything in IT, that level of complexity will often lead to problems.  

### Experiments

* Install virtualenv on your workstation using pip

	```
	pip install virtualenv 
	```

* Create a new folder for this experiement 

	``` 
	mkdir imapex101venvlab
	cd imapex101venvlab
	
	```

* Create a new virtualenv in this directory.  It will create a new folder called `venv` containing an independent copy of python as well as pip for module management 
	
	```
	virtualenv venv 
	
	New python executable in /Users/hapresto/coding/imapex101/examples/imapex101venvlab/venv/bin/python
	Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
	
	```
	
* You need to activate the new virtualenv to use it

	```
	source venv/bin/activate 
	
	# this will change your prompt to indicate you are now in the environment

* Check current module installation status

	```
	pip freeze 
	
	# Nothing should be returned
	# Compare this to what we saw in the pip exercises 
	
	```

* Install a module in the environment and verify status

	```
	pip install requests 
	
	Collecting requests
	  Using cached requests-2.10.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
	Installing collected packages: requests
	Successfully installed requests-2.10.0
	
	pip freeze 
	
	requests==2.10.0
	
	```

* Create a requirements.txt file from the current status

	```
	pip freeze > requirements.txt 
	
	```

* Update the requirements.txt file to add a new dependency 

	```
	echo "Flask==0.10.1" >> requirements.txt 
	
	# Verify the new file 
	cat requirements.txt
	
	requests==2.10.0
	Flask==0.10.1
	```

* Use pip to read in the requirements and verify the virtualenv meets all needed requirements.  

	```
	pip install -r requirements.txt

### Why do we care

In development today, it is not only good practice, but it's expected to provide software with dependency isolation.  If you're building a python application that will be downloaded and ran on a host, virtualenv for python is a standard way to do this.  

However, more and more applciations are being packaged in containers (typically Docker containers) which provide a level of isolation even higher than a simple Virtual Environment.  You could create a Virtual Environment within a container, but if you are practicing good container strategy, that is likely not needed as part of final delivery.  

Though, in the development phase, you may choose to use virtualenv to develop within to avoid the extra steps of rebuilding a new container for every update and test.

### Go do it Exercises 

This exercise will combine the pip and virtualenv skills together.  As well as give you something new to extend the virtualenv skills to research... 

* Take a look at this sample django application on GitHub [kirpit/django-sample-app](https://github.com/kirpit/django-sample-app)
* Review the README, this lab is about setting up this application within a virtual environment on your workstation 
* Step 1 in the installation references a tool called **virtualenvwrapper**.  Check the link above that describes its value and install it with pip 
* Run through the installation of the sample application and start the web server

# Writing Test Cases

> “Testing is an infinite process of comparing the invisible to the ambiguous in order to avoid the unthinkable
> happening to the anonymous.”— James Bach

Whenever possible, any code that is going to be deployed as part of a CI/CD pipeline should include test cases. Ensuring
that a project has a good testing suite provides the following benefits:

* Requires less background knowledge for other developers to contribute
* Reduces failed deployments
* Makes code refactoring easier
* Helps identify where additional validation logic is required

Software testing has become so important that it is now evolving in Agile shops to the notion of test driven development,
which is to say, we will write our software tests before the code they will test is actually written.

While critically important, testing is very much an art vs a science, which forces you to think about your code differently
when writing code, you are primarily focused on how it will work.  Tests on the other hand, can force you to think about
how it can break, and therefore with testing as a top of mind, you can incorporate those thoughts into the coding cycle
and produce a more robust feature.

## Enough with the talk, let's write some code.

Let's assume we are working on a project that defines the following helper function


```

def doubler(n):
    """
    A simple doubler function
    :param n: int
    :return: int
    """
    return 2 * n

```

What do we know about the code, in the case of *doubler()* we know from the code that it takes an integer as an input
and returns an integer equal to two times the input. Great.. so what? In this simple example, not much can go wrong, but
we should test to document what the use case was for using after all what about the following usages?

```
print doubler(2)
print doubler('2')

```

As we've written these functions, we've made some assumptions about how they will be used, and by whom, but we also should
document those assumptions in the form of a test case(s).. We know we want to test a couple things.

* The function works - 2 x 2 = 4 and 4 x 2 = 8
* The function should receive an integer
* The function should return an integer

So let's get started. Python unittests is a common library used for testing, and the easiest to get started with.

```
import unittest

class HelperFunctionTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_001_valid_type_is_returned(self):
        print "Executing test {}".format(self)
        test = doubler(2)
        self.assertIsInstance(test, int)


    def test_002_double_4(self):
        print "Executing test {}".format(self)
        test = doubler(4)
        self.assertEqual(test, 8)


unittest.main()
```

Which should result in the following output

```
..
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 2 tests in 0.000s
Executing test test_001_valid_type_is_returned (__main__.HelperFunctionTests)
Executing test test_002_double_4 (__main__.HelperFunctionTests)

OK
```

### Quick Tips
* All test methods must start with test* or they will not be executed
* Tests must work isolated from one another
* Tests are executed in order by their name using pythons built-in ordering for strings


So we've accounted for all of the appropriate uses of our functions, but what happens if we start to think about how
it could break?  As we noted earlier, doubler('2') may or may not be very helpful, so let's try a test-driven development
approach assuming we wanted to add input validation to the doubler function and throw an exception if we don't receive
an integer


```
import unittest

class HelperFunctionTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_001_valid_type_is_returned(self):
        test = doubler(2)
        self.assertIsInstance(test, int)


    def test_002_double_4(self):
        test = doubler(4)
        self.assertEqual(test, 8)

    def test_003_invalid_type_raises_error(self):
        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):
            test = doubler('2')

unittest.main()

```

This time around executing our code we get the following:

```
..F
======================================================================
FAIL: test_003_invalid_type_raises_error (__main__.HelperFunctionTests)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/kecorbin/Library/Preferences/PyCharm50/scratches/scratch_1", line 41, in test_003_invalid_type_raises_error
    test = doubler('2')
AssertionError: TypeError not raised

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 3 tests in 0.001s

FAILED (failures=1)
```

So we've verified the condition we are attempting to correct though the use of a test case, now let's modify our function
and add some input validation

```
def doubler(n):
    """
    A slightly more robust doubler function
    :param n: int
    :return: int
    """
    if isinstance(n, int):
        return 2 * n
    else:
        raise TypeError('n must be of type integer')

```

And with our more robust helper function in place, we'll test the code again.

```
...
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Ran 3 tests in 0.000s

OK

```

By leveraging a test-driven development approach, we've verified that we've successfully implemented the enhancement that
we intended to, and best of all once the code is done, we don't have to worry about writing tests!!!






# Linting

> At the end of the day, ship the fucking thing! It’s great to rewrite your code and make it cleaner and by the
> third time it’ll actually be pretty. But that’s not the point—you’re not here to write code;
> you’re here to ship products. - Jamie Zawinsky

Linting refers to a static code analysis for issues with the code, largely related to coding style, but also issues that may cause bugs to manifest down the road.  

The python community provides guidance on coding convention and style through [PEP](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Linters are a good way of verifying that the code you have written conforms to PEP.  A simple example of a linter for python is [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) which is available via pypi

     pip install flake8 
     
 Once installed linting your code is as easy as typing 
 
     flake8 mycode.py
    
 Or for a larger project, you can simply run flake8 from the root of your project. 

### What are you waiting for, Give it a try on some of your code!!!!!

### Tips:
* Sometimes you may choose to ignore certain errors that flake8 will throw, [here](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/ignoring-errors.html) is a good resource on ignoring them. Cliffs note version, end a line w/ 
   
	```# flake8: noqa```
* You can also version control the configuration for flake8 by adding a .flake8 file to the root of your project, here's a sample

```
[flake8]
ignore = D203
exclude = .git,__pycache__,docs/source/conf.py,old,build,dist
max-complexity = 10
```
