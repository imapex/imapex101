Within a single Repository, tags are used to provide different versions of what is typically the same application or service.  Some common uses of the tags would be:

* Actual version control
	* It is common to see tags like **:v0.1**, **:v0.2**, **:v0.3**
* Variations of the base image
	* **python:2-alpine**, **python:2-wheezy**, **python:2-slim**
* Stages of Development
	* **:dev**, **:prod**, **:qa**
* Indications of Git Branches/Tags
	* **:feature/test**, **:feature/ui**, **:master**
